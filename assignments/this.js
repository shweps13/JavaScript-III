* 1. When we working with "this" in global scope - the value of "this" will be whole window.
* 2. When we invoke the function with dot - object before function will be "this".
* 3. When we use "this" in the constructor function it's refers to specific object which one will be created and returned by constructor function.
* 4. When we use "apply" or "call" - we know that "this" is defined.
